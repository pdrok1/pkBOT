# pkBOT
PeaceKeeper Discord BOT made in Node.js. Struggling to make my first Node solution work xD.

Keeps memory log on 24 hours persistency. After 2 kick upvotes, the third will make a ban. Only works for one discord server at a time, for now.
Language: Brazilian Portuguese initially

!pk kick @<user> reason
  
Example:
!pk kick @Ryan Cause he's annoying at channel example.
